## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Cercle1 contain 3 projects : ft_printf get_next_line and Born2beRoot. Both of this project is individual.

## ft_printf <a name="ftprintf"></a>

This project is pretty straightforward, we have to recode printf. we will learn what is and how to implement variadic functions. We will reuse this function in our future projects. View [ft_printf subject](https://github.com/tdutel/Cercle1/blob/main/ft_printf/en.subject.pdf)

## get_next_line <a name="gnl"></a>

May it be a file, stdin, or even later a network connection, we will always need a way to read content line by line. It's time to start working on this function, which will be essential for our future projects. View [get_next_line subject](https://github.com/tdutel/Cercle1/blob/main/get_next_line/en.subject.pdf)

## Born2beRoot <a name="b2b"></a>

Born2beRoot cannot be shown in this repo because it's a virutal machine project. You can also view [Born2beRoot subject](https://github.com/tdutel/Cercle1/blob/main/Born2beRoot/en.subject.pdf)

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

1. Copy link : https://github.com/tdutel/Cercle1.git
2. tap in terminal :
```
git clone https://github.com/tdutel/Cercle1.git
cd Cercle1/ft_printf
```
Theses functions will be added into libft.a from [Libft project](https://github.com/tdutel/Cercle0). It is not really usefull to copy this repo. It rather here to show how it works instead of usage.
